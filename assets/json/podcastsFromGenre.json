      "description": "<em>To Catch A Hacker is an audio series about cybercrime, what really happens, how we find the people behind the crimes, and how they are brought to justice. Each season follows the story of a cybercrime and tracks the case until it is solved. But these cases are the success stories. We know one in four American households are victimized by cybercrime. Most never report what happened to the police. Of the tiny fraction that ARE reported, only 3 in 1000 incidents ever see an arrest. This makes cybercrime the most prevalent form of crime in America, with the lowest enforcement rate. In looking at the solved cases, we’ll see where we’re falling short in addressing the realities of cybercrime and why catching the cyber criminal is so rare. </em><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> See <a style='color:grey;' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'>acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p>",
